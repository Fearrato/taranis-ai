CONTENT: In February 2024, still-Supported Microsoft Outlook versions got an official patch for CVE-2024-21413, a vulnerability that allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary code on user&#39;s computer when the user opened a malicious hyperlink in attacker&#39;s email.
The vulnerability was discovered by Haifei Li of Check Point Research, who also wrote a detailed analysis. Haifei reported it as a bypass for an existing security mechanism, whereby Outlook refuses to open a file from a shared folder on the Internet (which could expose user&#39;s NTLM credentials in the process).
